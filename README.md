# GifTastic! 
## Problem 
I needed to learn how to do API calls and manipulate the DOM with JQuery. 
## Solution 
Program a fun to use, colourful site that allows a user to search for "gifs" via the "Giphy" API
## Technical Approach 
The solution using an AJAX call via the JQuery API to query the Giphy API for both a static and an animated version of 10 gifs based on the search queries embedded into the pre-existing buttons. 

The user can also add new buttons to the DOM for additional searches
